> [!ABSTRACT]- ABSTRACT
>  
> Despite high heritability, autism is genetically very heterogeneous. This raises the question of whether there are many different pathologies presenting as autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), or whether the myriad genetic causes converge on a few biological pathways affected in most individuals, which could be therapeutically targeted. A study using transcriptome and gene co-expression network analysis suggests that the latter, convergent model is the case. The gene expression patterns that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are much less pronounced in the ASD brain, and specific splicing abnormalities and modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism are enriched for previously identified genetic association signals. This points to transcriptional and splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in this disorder.
